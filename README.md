This repo is meant for the mentors' use. If you're a student, goooo awwaayyyyyyy.

No, seriously. this is for mentors' use. All these problems have solutions in them.

to solve them.

I'll be updating this regularly as I sort through more stuff.

PRs welcome, folks. And issues/bug reports/suggestions. Come at me. Brah.
